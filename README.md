# IntroToWebDevelopmentCourse-B-
Intro To Web Development(B) CSS Goodwillcareercampus course During my time with AmeriCorp I served as a Front End developer/ Web development trainer 
and Career resource connector for Goodwill BigBend and the Goodwill Career Campus which is an online and brick and mortar alternative educational system 
designed to afford opportunities to those in hopes of a new career, by either furthering their own or learning new skills to make their own.

The Intro to Web Development Course 1-3 (HTML, CSS, JS) were designed to break down the web to reusable concepts, patterns, and tool sets so that students 
can take advantage of its power.

Each course has its own set of resources that can be used at will during the class or when taking the class test and or quizzes.

There are a total of 3 quizzes and one Cumulitative test included with each class as a web app. You are more than welcome to take a deep dive into the different files for each quiz and or test to better assist you in passing.

There is no room for failure only lessons learned, You must answer all questions correctly in order to pass, for that reason there are built in Tips button to assist you if you get stuck along the way.

This class Started Aug, 2015 in Tallahassee, fl Goodwill prosperity center and now can be taken online at www.gwcareercampus
